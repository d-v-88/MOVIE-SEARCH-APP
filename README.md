# DESCRIPTION
The Movie Search App is a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web application built to provide users with a seamless experience for discovering detailed information about their favorite movies. It leverages the power of the OMDB (Open Movie Database) API, allowing users to search for any movie and view real-time data fetched directly from a trusted external source. This includes essential information such as the movie's release year, poster image, and whether the movie has been saved by the user or not.

At its core, the application is designed to be minimal yet functional. Users simply need to enter a movie title into the search bar, and upon submission, the app instantly performs an API call to OMDB. The results are then displayed in a clean, easy-to-navigate format that includes a list of closely matched movie titles. This not only improves user interaction but also allows users to discover new titles they may not have been aware of. The application handles all types of input, whether the movie name is entered in full or partially, and provides accurate matches accordingly.

One of the key focuses of the Movie Search App is responsive design. Whether users access the app from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the layout adjusts to provide a consistent and smooth user experience. This mobile-first approach ensures accessibility for all types of users without compromising on speed or functionality.

Security and best practices were also considered in the development process. The OMDB API key, which is essential for fetching data, is stored securely in a .env file. This prevents it from being exposed in the codebase or being accidentally pushed to public repositories. Using environment variables reflects good development hygiene and aligns with modern coding standards, especially when working with third-party APIs.

A unique feature added to the app is the ability to save movies. Users can mark certain movies as “saved” for future reference. This feature adds a personalized touch, giving users the ability to build their own mini watchlist directly within the application. Although the current version uses local storage for this functionality, it lays the groundwork for more advanced features like login and persistent user data in future updates.
